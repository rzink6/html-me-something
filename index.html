            <h3 class="header">How it all Started</h3>
            <p>
                I just had a baby. I wanted to save money. So of course we ventured into the world of cloth diapers. With cloth diapers came cloth
                wipes, but those were expensive. Enter the sewing machine. My neighbor took me out to pick up this old Singer 401A in a beautiul 
                full-sized desk. The gears were a bit gummed up, but she ran and my neighbor assured me that it would be an easy fix. So &#36;80 later,
                I had this machine loaded into the back of her car. About &#36;50 in cleaning and sewing supplies later, and I was ready to make my first
                cloth wipes. The wipes that I didn't want to spend about &#36;24 on. Those ones. I sat down after putting the baby down for bed one
                evening, and I was hooked.

            The collection started slowly at first. Some flannel here, because I <em>was</em> just making some flannel wipes after all,
            some fleece there. I began dreaming about making a quilt, so some quilters cotton made its way into my home. Over time, I joined
            several destashing pages on facebook to buy more fabric. I learned to sew dresses for the not so little baby, and purchased a 
            pattern or two for skirts for myself as well. It was going great. Except the fabric was being purchased faster than I could sew it up.
            I was running out of space to put it all. I purchased more shelves, and filled those as well. And that wasn't even the start of it.

        <h3 class="header">Enter: Serger</h3>
        <p>
            We moved. I packed up 3 large boxes of fabric and unpacked them all, arranged my shelves, and realized I had more space to fill now.
            I discovered knit fabrics. They were soft, stretchy, and perfect for every day clothes. I <em>had</em> to have them! So I started
            small. Buying a couple yards here, a couple yards there. It accumulated quickly though. We bought more shelving, I bought more fabric,
            it's just how things worked. It was only then that I learned my precious 401A would not work well with knit fabric. I had this stash
            that I couldn't use even if I had the time. That's how I learned about sergers. I did my research, saved up some, and eventually
            purchased a wonderful little machine. The fabric glides through it like a dream and I have beautiful clothes with every whim I get.
            One day I'll use all the fabric up, but until then, I'll use it to make life just a little bit prettier.
